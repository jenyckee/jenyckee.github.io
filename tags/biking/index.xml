&lt;p&gt;During last summer I was looking for inspiration to do a long term mountain biking trip that would be challenging but pretty risk free at the same time. I had a time frame of three weeks in November so I started to look into possibilities when quickly my eye fell on a flight to Kathmandu. Nepal ticked off all the boxes I was looking for in my next trip, so without too much overthinking slightly nervous I booked the flights.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Visualizing the availability of Brussels villo bikes</title><link>https://jenyckee.github.io/posts/villoviz/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 18:46:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jenyckee.github.io/posts/villoviz/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After exploring what the city of Brussel is exposing in its open data platform I decided to do something with the data on the Villo bikes. Villo is a local bike sharing system by the city that allows you to take out a bike at one bike station and leave it at another. The Brussels open data platform has an endpoint that gives a live feed of the availability of each of the bike stations all over the city. I thought it would be interesting to visualize over time how the bike stations are being used. Therefore I set up a task on Amazon AWS that makes a request every 5 minutes to get a status on the availabilities and stores them in a database. I let it run for the night during rush hour from 15h30 till 22h.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fatbiking in the Cairngorms</title><link>https://jenyckee.github.io/posts/cairngorms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 17:46:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jenyckee.github.io/posts/cairngorms/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This winter in December I took a little escape from work to the Cairngorms national park in Scotland. I had been curious about riding a fatbike for quite some time and after seeing &amp;ldquo;Mountain Bikes and Bothy Nights&amp;rdquo; by Alastair Humphreys, a great video about bothy culture I thought this would be the perfect area to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that I Recently have been intrigued by steel bike frames. This for a couple of reasons. Steel bike frames are usually stiffer, tough heavier than aluminum frames. They are cheaper and more durable than carbon frames. And overall they just look cool.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
