I would like to write down some of the ideas that resonated with me. To do this I will focus on 3 big themes that seemed to come back in all of the talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="context-and-suspense"&gt;Context and Suspense&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since React 16.3 Context and Suspense are two new features that will shape the architectures of client side React applications. Context is a feauture that has been around in the React API since quite a while. The use of it however has always been discouraged. A simple example that shows the power of it would be to show how we can simplify data fetching with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
