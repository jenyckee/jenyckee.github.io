When I saw this I was wondering if I could build a model to trace individual people and eventually track their behaviour while walking on one of the most touristy spots in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up a website with TensorFlow.js using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd"&gt;coco-ssd&lt;/a&gt; model but was slightly dissapointed with the results. After doing some more research I read about transfer learning and decided to try and improve model.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dimension scanner for medals</title><link>https://jenyckee.github.io/posts/cnc-medals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 10:55:21 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jenyckee.github.io/posts/cnc-medals/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I got the question from a client who was making frames for medal with a cnc machine if we could determine the dimensions of a medal from a simple picture. Today the client has to request the physical medals being mailed to him in order to be able to create the digital model that can be consumed by his CNC machine. iOS 12 comes these days with the Measure app that uses augmented reality to provide dimension information on objects that are being scanned with the camera.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
