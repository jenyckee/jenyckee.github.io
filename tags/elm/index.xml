      <description>One of the most defining courses I took during university was &amp;ldquo;Functional Programming&amp;rdquo;. After being introduced to other paradigms such as object oriented programming in the bachelor years it was possible to learn Haskell in this course and thus delve deeper into the functional programming paradigm. At the end of the course I developed a web application using Snap. After that I got more involved into front end development using JavaScript and always missed the developer experience that I got when programming in Haskell.</description>
