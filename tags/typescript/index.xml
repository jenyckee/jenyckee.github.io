      <description>Intention The intention of this post is to sum up some thoughts on TypeScript that come from my own experience of working with it.
As with all engineering the right tool for the job is always dependent on the context of the job. The context where I would consider using TypeScript would be on projects that have a large codebase that will be developed and maintained by a large team of developers that have preliminary JavaScript or TypeScript knowledge.</description>
